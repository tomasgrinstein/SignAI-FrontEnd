# Sign AI

Sign AI is a project aimed at facilitating communication for people who use sign language. Through a web page, users can translate what they want to say into written text and even autocomplete with the help of Gemini or OpenAI APIs. The sign detection is done through artificial intelligence that processes in real time what the camera captures, using a Large Language Model (LLM).

## Objective

The main objective of Sign AI is to provide an accessible and efficient tool for translating American Sign Language (ASL) into text. This platform is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to simply point their cameras at their sign gestures while the AI interprets and converts these gestures into written text.
